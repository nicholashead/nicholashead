Hello! I am a software engineer who's been doing this professionally for 20 years now (since 2000), but have been dabbling with computers and tech for almost 30 years now.

I have many esoteric interests, such as film, music, video games and television.

Currently I work for [HireAHelper](https://www.hireahelper.com/), which is part of [Porch](https://www.porch.com/)
